- The name of this project is an acronym for cardiac output simulator in portuguese ("simulador de débito cardíaco");
  
- This repository on GitHub is a folder to store files, code and revision history for a project developed by the author (CFT de Abreu, @caioternus). Other images and content can be found on Flickr, Springer Nature and ResearchGate as well;

- This project system gathers software and hardware prototypes that work together. There is a graphical user interface (GUI) for the end user to manage and view the progress of the simulation. It was developed using C++ language;

- This simulator aims to reproduce the measurement of the blood flow (also known as "cardiac output") performed through the pulmonary artery catheter (also known as "Swan-Ganz catheter" or the acronym "PAC") to support medical/clinical training (e.g. nurses, healthcare teams, medical students, catheterization and surgery students, cardiology apprentices, medical education in overall). Currently, commercial simulators available on the market have limitations and bypass the pulmonary artery catheter's thermistor (temperature sensor) which is an indispensable part of the measurement system;

- The hardware recreates the temperature variations as occured into the pulmonary artery catheter during the procedure of thermodilution. The hardware system uses a device known as thermoelectric module, and this component is controlled by an embedded system containing a microcontroller chip (with a firmware code written in Assembly language by the author) along with other electronic circuits and elements;

- Therefore, the software prototypes were developed in two programming languages: C++ and Assembly (see the file "Simdeb_assembly.txt");
  
- The files "Simdeb software.jpg" and "Simdeb software 2.jpg" show the front-end graphical user interface software before and after the cardiac output simulation;
